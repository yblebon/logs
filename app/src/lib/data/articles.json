      "summary": "The pages of MKUltraâ€™s history are stained with ethical violations. In pursuit of their objectives, researchers administered drugs, including LSD, to unwitting subjects, often leading to severe psychological and physical consequences. These practices breached fundamental principles of informed consent and exposed the moral dilemmas arising when scientific aspirations disregard human rights.",
